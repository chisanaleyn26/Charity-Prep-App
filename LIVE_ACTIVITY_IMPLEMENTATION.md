# Live Activity Feed Implementation Summary

## What I've Done

### 1. **Integrated Real-time Activity Feed in Dashboard**
- Replaced static `ActivityFeed` with `RealtimeActivityFeed` component
- The feed now shows real activities from the database
- Supports both historical data and live updates via WebSocket

### 2. **Added Activity Logging to Key Pages**

#### Dashboard (`/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Logs page view when dashboard loads
logActivity({
  activity_type: ActivityTypes.PAGE_VIEW,
  metadata: { 
    page: 'dashboard',
    organization_id: currentOrganization.id,
    organization_name: currentOrganization.name
  }
})
```

#### Compliance Score (`/features/compliance/components/score/compliance-score-client.tsx`)
```typescript
// Logs when users view their compliance score
logActivity({
  activity_type: ActivityTypes.COMPLIANCE_SCORE_VIEW,
  metadata: {
    score: score,
    level: level,
    highPriorityActions: highPriorityActionCount
  }
})

// Also logs tab changes within the compliance score page
```

### 3. **Enhanced Activity Feed Display**
- Fixed icon mapping to handle both icon names and activity types
- Proper color coding based on activity severity/type
- Shows user names and timestamps
- Real-time "LIVE" indicator when connected

## How It Works

### Real-time Updates
1. **Database Triggers** automatically log when users:
   - Create/update/delete safeguarding records
   - Manage overseas activities
   - Upload/delete documents
   - Change team member roles

2. **WebSocket Subscriptions** listen for:
   - New activities in `user_activities` table
   - New audit logs in `audit_logs` table
   - Changes to monitored tables

3. **Activity Feed** displays:
   - Historical activities from API endpoint
   - Live updates as they happen
   - Rich context (user, action, timestamp)

### Activity Types Being Tracked

#### Automatic (via DB triggers):
- ✅ Safeguarding record changes
- ✅ Overseas activity management
- ✅ Document uploads/deletions
- ✅ Team member changes

#### Manual (via code):
- ✅ Page views (dashboard, compliance score)
- ✅ Compliance score checks
- ✅ Tab navigation in compliance score
- 🔄 Report generation (needs integration)
- 🔄 AI chat usage (needs integration)
- 🔄 Search queries (needs integration)

## What You'll See

In the dashboard's Live Activity section:
```
Live Activity                    LIVE 🟢
─────────────────────────────────────

## Next Steps to Fully Utilize

### 1. Add Activity Logging to More Features

#### Document Upload
```typescript
// In document upload handler
await logActivity({
  activity_type: ActivityTypes.DOCUMENT_UPLOAD,
  resource_id: doc.id,
  resource_name: file.name,
  metadata: { fileSize: file.size }
})
```

#### Report Generation
```typescript
// In report generation
await logActivity({
  activity_type: ActivityTypes.REPORT_GENERATE,
  resource_name: 'Q4 Board Pack',
  metadata: { reportType: 'board_pack' },
  duration_ms: generationTime
})
```

#### AI Chat
```typescript
// In AI chat component
await logActivity({
  activity_type: ActivityTypes.AI_CHAT_MESSAGE,
  metadata: { questionLength: message.length }
})
```

### 2. Create Activity Analytics Page
- Show activity trends over time
- Most active users
- Popular features
- Performance metrics

### 3. Add Filtering/Search to Activity Feed
- Filter by activity type
- Search by user
- Date range filters
- Export activity logs

## Benefits

1. **Transparency** - Users see what's happening in their organization
2. **Accountability** - All actions are tracked and visible
3. **Insights** - Understand how users interact with the platform
4. **Security** - Audit trail for compliance and security
5. **Real-time** - Live updates keep everyone informed

The infrastructure is now fully operational. The dashboard shows live activities, and as you add more activity logging throughout the app, they'll automatically appear in the feed!
