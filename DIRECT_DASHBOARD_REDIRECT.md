# Direct Dashboard Redirect Implementation

## What Was Changed

### Login Form Enhancement
The login form now checks for existing organizations immediately after successful OTP verification:

1. **Organization Check**: After OTP verification, the form queries the database to check if the user has any organizations
2. **Smart Redirect**: 
   - Users WITH organizations → Direct to `/dashboard`
   - Users WITHOUT organizations → Direct to `/onboarding`
3. **Loading States**: Shows progressive loading messages:
   - "Verifying..." → During OTP verification
   - "Setting up your account..." → While checking organizations
   - "Redirecting to dashboard..." → For existing users
   - "Redirecting to setup..." → For new users

## User Experience Flow

### Existing User:
1. Enter email → "Send Verification Code"
2. Enter OTP → "Verifying..."
3. "Setting up your account..."
4. "Redirecting to dashboard..."
5. → Dashboard (No onboarding check needed!)

### New User:
1. Enter email → "Send Verification Code"
2. Enter OTP → "Verifying..."
3. "Setting up your account..."
4. "Redirecting to setup..."
5. → Onboarding page

## Benefits
- **Faster navigation** for existing users
- **Clear feedback** with loading messages
- **No unnecessary redirects** or middleware checks
- **Smooth transitions** with brief delays to show status

The auth flow is now more intelligent and provides a better user experience by detecting the user's status immediately after login!
