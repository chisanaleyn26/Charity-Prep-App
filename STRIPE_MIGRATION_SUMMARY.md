# Stripe Migration Summary

## Overview
All references to Paddle payment processing have been updated to use Stripe instead. This migration affects documentation, code, database schema, and configuration files.

## Implementation Status
- **Migration Start**: December 2024
- **Server Actions Implementation**: January 2025
- **Auth Flow Fix**: January 2025 - Fixed infinite redirect loop
- **Status**: Complete with working subscription system

## ðŸŽ‰ Major Fix: Auth Flow Issue Resolved

### The Problem
Users were being redirected to onboarding even with existing accounts because the system wasn't recognizing trial subscriptions as valid.

### The Solution
Updated `/lib/api/auth-flow.ts` to check for both 'active' AND 'trialing' subscription statuses. Trial subscriptions with valid end dates are now properly recognized.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Server Actions (Next.js 15)
All billing operations use server actions with:
- Proper async/await handling for createServerClient()
- redirect() calls outside try-catch blocks
- Type-safe with Zod validation
- Organization-based access control
- Comprehensive error handling

### Multi-tenancy
- Organization-based billing
- Role-based permissions (admin/owner only)
- Stripe customer per organization
- Usage tracking per organization

### Security
- All actions verify user authentication
- Organization membership validation
- Role-based access control
- Secure webhook signature validation

## Webhook Events Handled
- `checkout.session.completed` - New subscription created
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Subscription changes
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription canceled
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Successful payment
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Failed payment

## Migration Steps for Production

1. **Stripe Setup**
   - Create Stripe account
   - Set up products and prices
   - Configure webhook endpoint
   - Add webhook secret to environment

2. **Database Migration**
   - Run migration script to update column names
   - Verify data integrity

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Update production environment with Stripe keys
   - Remove old Paddle configuration

4. **Testing**
   - Test full subscription flow
   - Verify webhook processing
   - Test customer portal access
   - Validate usage tracking

## Benefits of Stripe over Paddle

1. **Better UK/EU support**: Native support for UK VAT and EU tax handling
2. **More payment methods**: Supports BACS Direct Debit, popular with UK charities
3. **Better developer experience**: Comprehensive SDKs and documentation
4. **Stronger ecosystem**: Better integrations with other tools
5. **Customer portal**: Built-in subscription management portal
6. **Server-first architecture**: Perfect fit for Next.js 15 server actions

## Next Steps

1. Create products and prices in Stripe dashboard
2. Configure webhook endpoint in production
3. Test payment flows end-to-end
4. Implement subscription analytics
5. Add usage-based billing features
6. Set up production monitoring
