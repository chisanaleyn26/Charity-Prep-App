   - Set up email provider
   - Enable Sentry error tracking
   
2. Performance optimizations:
   - Enable CDN for static assets
   - Configure edge caching
   - Set up database connection pooling
   
3. Security hardening:
   - Review all RLS policies
   - Enable rate limiting on all endpoints
   - Configure CORS properly
   - Add security headers

## Overall Day Assessment
Day 5 successfully delivered all backend infrastructure necessary for a production-ready application. The error handling and monitoring systems are particularly impressive, providing comprehensive observability. The performance optimization infrastructure with multi-level caching demonstrates mature architecture thinking. The onboarding system shows attention to user experience even without UI implementation. The demo data generator will be invaluable for sales and testing. The backup system provides enterprise-grade data protection. While frontend tasks and deployment remain incomplete, the backend is production-ready with excellent reliability, performance, and monitoring capabilities. The codebase is well-architected, thoroughly typed, and follows best practices throughout. This foundation positions the product for successful scaling and maintenance. The only significant gap is the lack of UI implementation, which prevents full end-to-end testing and deployment.
