# Reports Module Implementation Plan

## Current Status
Based on comprehensive analysis, the reports module is 95% complete with all major functionality implemented. However, we need to:
1. Verify all components are working correctly
2. Fix any integration issues
3. Implement missing enhancements
4. Ensure consistency with the rest of the application

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Verification & Testing (Day 1)
1. **Annual Return Module**
   - [ ] Test data aggregation from all compliance modules

   - [ ] Ensure progress tracking works correctly

2. **Board Pack Module**
   - [ ] Test all template types (Standard/Concise/Quarterly)
   - [ ] Verify AI narrative generation integration
   - [ ] Test PDF generation quality
   - [ ] Check all section components render correctly

3. **Certificates Module**
   - [ ] Test certificate generation based on achievements
   - [ ] Verify different certificate types
   - [ ] Test download functionality
   - [ ] Check achievement calculations

4. **Export Module**
   - [ ] Test all export formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, PDF)
   - [ ] Verify custom date range exports
   - [ ] Test module-specific exports
   - [ ] Check export history tracking

5. **AI Reports Module**
   - [ ] Test AI narrative generation
   - [ ] Verify all report types
   - [ ] Test tone and length options
   - [ ] Check download functionality

### Phase 2: Bug Fixes & Integration (Day 2)
1. **Fix Any Broken Components**
   - [ ] Address TypeScript errors
   - [ ] Fix missing imports
   - [ ] Resolve API integration issues
   - [ ] Fix UI/UX inconsistencies

2. **Ensure Data Flow**
   - [ ] Verify all services connect to Supabase correctly
   - [ ] Test organization context throughout
   - [ ] Ensure proper error handling
   - [ ] Add loading states where missing

### Phase 3: Missing Features Implementation (Day 3)
1. **Email Export Delivery**
   - [ ] Create email service integration
   - [ ] Add email export option to UI
   - [ ] Test email delivery

2. **Report Scheduling Backend**
   - [ ] Implement cron job system
   - [ ] Create scheduled export API
   - [ ] Test recurring exports

3. **Export Progress Tracking**
   - [ ] Add real-time progress updates
   - [ ] Implement job status API
   - [ ] Update UI to show progress

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Add caching for expensive queries
   - [ ] Optimize data aggregation
   - [ ] Improve PDF generation speed

### Phase 4: Polish & Documentation (Day 4)
1. **UI/UX Consistency**
   - [ ] Match design with compliance pages
   - [ ] Add proper loading states
   - [ ] Improve error messages
   - [ ] Add help tooltips

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Create user guide for each report type
   - [ ] Document API endpoints
   - [ ] Add inline help text
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Order

1. **Start with Main Reports Page** - Ensure dashboard is functional
2. **Annual Return** - Most critical for charities
3. **Board Pack** - High value for trustees
4. **Export Module** - Core functionality needed by all
5. **AI Reports** - Advanced feature building on others
6. **Certificates** - Nice-to-have feature

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All report types generate without errors
- [ ] Data is accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Exports work in all formats
- [ ] AI integration functions properly
- [ ] UI is consistent with rest of application
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (<3s load times)
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved

## Risk Mitigation

1. **AI Service Failures**
   - Implement fallback to template-based reports
   - Cache successful AI responses
   - Add retry logic

2. **Large Data Exports**
   - Implement pagination
   - Add progress indicators
   - Consider background processing

3. **PDF Generation Issues**
   - Have HTML fallback
   - Test across browsers
   - Consider server-side generation

## Next Steps

1. Create individual .md files for each module as we implement
2. Start with verification of existing functionality
3. Fix any issues before adding new features
4. Document everything as we go
