# Organization Simplification - Cleanup Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. **Fixed Critical Auth Bug**
- Users were creating 5-7 duplicate organizations due to login flow bug
- Fixed by changing `.single()` to `.limit(1)` in login check

### 2. **Removed Organization Picker**
- Replaced complex dropdown with simple badge
- Removed ~300 lines of switching logic
- Simplified state management

### 3. **Cleaned Up Architecture**
- Simplified auth store (removed multi-org arrays)
- Simplified organization provider (removed switching)
- Fixed dashboard to use context properly
- Updated all imports and references

## Files Changed

### Core Changes
- `app/login/page.tsx` - Fixed organization check
- `components/layout/organization-badge.tsx` - New simple badge
- `stores/auth-store.ts` - Simplified to single org
- `features/organizations/components/organization-provider.tsx` - Removed switching
- `components/layout/sidebar.tsx` - Use badge instead of picker
- `components/layout/mobile-sidebar.tsx` - Use badge instead of picker
- `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Use organization context
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Server-side redirect check
- `app/onboarding/new/page.tsx` - Simplified onboarding form

### Backup Files Created
- `stores/auth-store-old.ts` - Original with multi-org support
- `features/organizations/components/organization-provider-old.tsx` - Original with switching
- `features/organizations/components/org-switcher.tsx` - Can be deleted

## Database Cleanup Needed

Found users with duplicate organizations:
- `jandomnato@gmail.com` - 7 organizations named "Dominic Nato"
- `rodj.faburada@gmail.com` - 5 organizations (4 named "St. Mary's Trust")

Created cleanup script: `scripts/cleanup-duplicate-orgs.sql`

## Testing Results

✅ Login with existing user → Dashboard  
✅ Login with new user → Onboarding  
✅ Organization badge displays correctly  
✅ No org picker visible  
✅ Dashboard uses correct organization  

## Next Steps

1. **Run cleanup script** to remove duplicate organizations
2. **Delete old files**:
   - `stores/auth-store-old.ts`
   - `features/organizations/components/organization-provider-old.tsx`
   - `features/organizations/components/org-switcher.tsx`
3. **Update any remaining references** in test files
4. **Monitor** for any users still creating duplicates

## Impact

- **Performance**: Faster loads without org list fetching
- **UX**: Cleaner, simpler interface
- **Reliability**: No more duplicate org bug
- **Maintainability**: Much simpler codebase

The app is now aligned with actual user behavior - one charity per user!
