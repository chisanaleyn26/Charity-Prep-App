# Decision Log

[2025-01-26 09:00:00] - Server-First Architecture
**Context**: Building a compliance platform that needs excellent performance and SEO
**Decision**: Use Next.js 15.2 Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
**Rationale**: Better performance, SEO, and simpler data fetching patterns
**Implications**: Components must be designed for server rendering, use Server Actions for mutations

[2025-01-26 09:00:00] - Zustand for UI State Only
**Context**: Need state management but want to avoid complexity
**Decision**: Use Zustand only for client-side UI state, not server data
**Rationale**: Server should be the source of truth for all data, client state only for UI interactions
**Implications**: No data fetching in Zustand stores, use Server Components for data

[2025-01-26 09:00:00] - Feature-Based Organization
**Context**: Multiple developers working in parallel on 5-day build
**Decision**: Organize code by features (compliance, ai, reports) not layers
**Rationale**: Allows independent development with clear boundaries
**Implications**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, actions, and types

[2025-01-26 09:00:00] - Supabase + MCP Integration
**Context**: Need real-time database with auth and storage
**Decision**: Use Supabase with MCP integration for all database operations
**Rationale**: Provides complete backend infrastructure with real-time capabilities
**Implications**: All database operations go through Supabase client libraries
