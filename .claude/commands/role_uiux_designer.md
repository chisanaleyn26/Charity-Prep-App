I want you to think as the best UI/UX designer in the world. Carefully observe and analyze the pages related to our implementation ... Do not take any action yet.

ULTRATHINK through:
1. Information architecture and visual hierarchy
2. User flows and points of friction
3. Emotional response and psychological impact, ensuring we are using fear as the motivating behavior (risks and implications of not being compliant)
4. Conversion optimization opportunities
5. Accessibility and cross-device consistency
6. Alignment with business goals and user needs
7. Effectiveness of driving lead generation (getting contact details) and getting a demo booked

Complete this ULTRATHINK analysis thoroughly and silently. I will then give you specific instructions.
