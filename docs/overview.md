# Charity Prep - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

Charity Prep is a SaaS platform that helps UK charities comply with the new Charities (Annual Return) Regulations 2024. These regulations require significantly more detailed reporting starting with financial years ending after January 1, 2025, creating an urgent need for specialized compliance software.

**Problem**: 100,000+ charities in England & Wales must now track and report extensive new data on safeguarding, overseas expenditure, and fundraising methods - a massive administrative burden for organizations with limited resources.

**Solution**: Charity Prep provides purpose-built tools to track required data year-round, with AI-powered features for intelligent data entry, automated compliance scoring, and one-click report generation.

**Opportunity**: First-mover advantage in a greenfield market with immediate, mandatory demand and no direct competition.

## The Regulatory Driver

The Charities (Annual Return) Regulations 2024 expand reporting requirements from 16 to 26+ core questions, with new focus on:

- **Safeguarding**: Detailed DBS check tracking, training records, policy reviews
- **International Operations**: Country-by-country expenditure, transfer methods, partner details
- **Fundraising**: Income source breakdown, major donor disclosure, methods used
- **Financial Transparency**: Related party transactions, highest donations, grant analysis

First affected returns are due late 2025/early 2026, creating immediate urgency for preparation tools.
