# Home Page Deep Investigation

## Current Understanding
The home page at `/` should render but content is not visible despite fixing color issues.

## Investigation Plan

### 1. Route & File Structure Analysis
- [ ] Verify `/app/page.tsx` is the correct home page
- [ ] Check if any route groups are affecting it
- [ ] Identify all layouts that wrap the home page
- [ ] Check for middleware interference

### 2. Component Chain Analysis
```
/ (root URL)
  → app/page.tsx
    → imports Hero from '@/components/marketing/hero'
    → imports Features from '@/components/marketing/features'  
    → imports Pricing from '@/components/marketing/pricing'
    → imports Footer from '@/components/marketing/footer'
```

### 3. Layout Wrapping Chain
```
app/layout.tsx (root layout)
  → applies Inter font
  → imports globals.css
  → wraps all pages
  
Is there another layout?
```

### 4. CSS Loading Chain
```
globals.css
  → @tailwind directives
  → CSS variables
  → base styles
  
Are styles being applied?
```

### 5. Potential Issues to Check
1. **Empty Fragment Issue**: Using `<>` might cause issues
2. **Missing Layout**: Home page might need marketing layout
3. **CSS Not Loading**: Tailwind might not be processing
4. **Wrong Route**: Page might not be at `/`
5. **Build Cache**: Old build artifacts
6. **Component Errors**: Silent failures in components
7. **Hydration Mismatches**: Client/server differences

### 6. Tests to Run
1. Add visible debug content directly in page.tsx
2. Test with static HTML (no components)
3. Test with simplified components
4. Check browser DevTools for errors
5. Verify CSS is loaded in browser
6. Check rendered HTML structure

### 7. My Thoughts
I suspect one of these scenarios:
1. The page is rendering but there's an overlay hiding it
2. The marketing layout isn't being applied
3. CSS isn't loading properly due to a build issue
4. There's a hydration error causing React to fail silently
5. The route isn't matching properly

Let me investigate each systematically.
