# Compliance Chat Fix Summary

## Problem
The compliance chat page was not working due to server actions being called directly from a client component. This violates Next.js App Router rules where server actions cannot be imported and used directly in client components.

## Solution
1. Created an API route at `/app/api/ai/compliance-chat/route.ts` that handles chat requests
2. Updated the `compliance-chat.tsx` component to use fetch() to call the API route instead of importing server actions
3. Moved type definitions locally into the component since they can't be imported from server modules

## Changes Made

### 1. Created API Route
- Path: `/app/api/ai/compliance-chat/route.ts`
- Handles POST requests with question, context, and history
- Returns formatted chat response with sources

### 2. Updated Compliance Chat Component
- Removed imports of server actions
- Added local type definitions for ChatMessage and ChatContext
- Updated `handleSendMessage` to use fetch() to call the API endpoint
- Replaced server action calls with local implementations for suggested questions and alerts
- Added proper error handling for API responses

### 3. Testing
- Verified the API endpoint works correctly with curl
- Confirmed the compliance chat page loads without errors
- Tested chat functionality with sample questions

## Result
The compliance chat feature is now fully functional and follows Next.js best practices for client-server communication.
