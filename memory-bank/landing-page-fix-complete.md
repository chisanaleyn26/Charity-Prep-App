# Landing Page Fix Complete

## Root Cause Identified
The landing page content was not visible because the text colors were using CSS variables from the theme system that weren't resolving correctly:
- `text-foreground` → CSS variable `hsl(var(--foreground))`
- `text-muted-foreground` → CSS variable `hsl(var(--muted-foreground))`
- `bg-ethereal` → Custom color from theme
- `border-ethereal` → Custom color from theme

## Solution Implemented
Replaced all CSS variable-based color classes with standard Tailwind colors that are guaranteed to work:

### Color Replacements Made:
1. **Text Colors:**
   - `text-foreground` → `text-gray-900`
   - `text-muted-foreground` → `text-gray-600`
   - `text-muted-foreground/70` → `text-gray-500`

2. **Background Colors:**
   - `bg-ethereal` → `bg-green-400`
   - `hover:bg-ethereal/90` → `hover:bg-green-500`

3. **Border Colors:**
   - `border-ethereal` → `border-green-400`
   - `bg-border` → `bg-gray-300`

## Files Fixed:
1. `/components/marketing/hero.tsx` - All text and accent colors
2. `/components/marketing/features.tsx` - Headings and body text
3. `/components/marketing/pricing.tsx` - All pricing card text
4. `/components/marketing/footer.tsx` - Footer text colors

## Result:
The landing page content should now be fully visible with:
- Black/gray text that contrasts well with white/light backgrounds
- Green accents (using green-400/500 instead of ethereal)
- Proper hover states and transitions

## Why This Happened:
The CSS variables defined in `globals.css` weren't being properly resolved in the components, possibly due to:
1. PostCSS processing issues
2. CSS variable scope problems
3. Tailwind's JIT compiler not recognizing the custom color classes

## Long-term Fix:
To properly use the theme system in the future:
1. Ensure CSS variables are loaded before components
2. Test color contrast in development
3. Consider using Tailwind's built-in color system for critical UI elements
4. Keep theme colors for non-critical decorative elements
