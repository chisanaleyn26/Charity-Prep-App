# Day 5: Annual Return Fix - Client/Server Separation

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the 'use client' and 'use server' issue in Annual Return components by properly separating server and client responsibilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Server Component Wrapper
- **File**: `/features/reports/annual-return/components/ARGeneratorServer.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Handles server-side data fetching before rendering client component
- **Benefits**: 
  - Pre-fetches data on server for better performance
  - Proper error handling at server level
  - Clean separation of concerns

### 2. Updated Client Component
- **File**: `/features/reports/annual-return/components/ARGenerator.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `initialError` prop to handle server-side errors
  - Updated state initialization to account for initial error
  - Modified useEffect to prevent redundant data fetching

### 3. Fixed Server Action
- **File**: `/features/reports/annual-return/actions/annual-return.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed organization lookup to use proper join with organization_members table
  - Removed dependency on user.user_metadata which might not exist
  - Improved error messages

### 4. Updated Page Component
- **File**: `/app/(app)/reports/annual-return/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Now imports ARGeneratorServer instead of ARGenerator directly
  - Maintains proper Suspense boundary for loading state

## Architecture Pattern
```
Page (Server Component)
  └── Suspense
       └── ARGeneratorServer (Async Server Component)
            └── ARGenerator (Client Component with interactivity)
```

## Key Learnings
1. Server actions can be imported into client components in Next.js App Router
2. Pre-fetching data in server components improves initial load performance
3. Proper error handling should happen at both server and client levels
4. Always use proper database joins instead of relying on metadata

## Testing Notes
- The component now properly handles authentication errors
- Loading states are shown correctly with Suspense
- Server actions work seamlessly with client-side interactivity
- No ESLint errors or warnings
