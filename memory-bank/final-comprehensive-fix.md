# Comprehensive Fix for Webpack and Page Loading Issues
## Date: 2025-01-29

### The Problem Cycle
1. When webpack errors are fixed with custom Link component → Pages don't load properly (CSS issues)
2. When pages load properly → Webpack errors appear

### Root Cause
This is a Next.js 15 hydration and module resolution conflict. The app is getting confused between server and client rendering.

### Solution Applied

1. **Reverted to native Next.js Link**
   - Removed custom Link wrapper
   - Using Next.js Link directly from 'next/link'

2. **Updated next.config.ts**
   - Added `transpilePackages: ['next']` to help with module resolution

3. **Added CSS loading verification**
   - Added marker in globals.css to verify Tailwind is loading

4. **Created test page** at `/test`
   - Uses inline styles to bypass CSS issues
   - Helps verify if routing works independently

### Recommended Actions

1. **Complete restart procedure**:
   ```bash
   # 1. Kill all Node processes
   pkill -f node
   
   # 2. Clear everything
   rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json
   
   # 3. Reinstall
   npm install
   
   # 4. Start fresh
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test in this order**:
   - Visit `/test` first (should work with inline styles)
   - Then visit `/` (home page)
   - Check browser console for CSS loading messages

3. **If issues persist**, the problem might be:
   - Replit-specific environment issues
   - Conflicting Node.js versions
   - Corrupted npm cache

### Alternative Solution
If the cycle continues, consider:
1. Downgrading to Next.js 14.x which has more stable module resolution
2. Using a different development environment
3. Creating a fresh Next.js project and migrating code

### Key Insight
The issue appears to be related to how Next.js 15 handles module resolution in development mode, particularly with the Link component and CSS-in-JS hydration.
