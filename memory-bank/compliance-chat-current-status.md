# Compliance Chat Current Status - May 27, 2025

## Summary
The compliance chat feature has been partially fixed but still has issues:

### What's Working
1. ✅ Page loads without JavaScript errors (fixed the `.length` error)
2. ✅ Authentication works with dev session
3. ✅ API route exists and responds to requests
4. ✅ Basic page structure renders

### What's Not Working
1. ❌ API returns 429 rate limit errors frequently
2. ❌ UI components not rendering properly:
   - Welcome message missing
   - Suggested questions not showing
   - Input field not visible
   - Quick Actions sidebar missing
   - Compliance Alerts section missing
3. ❌ The OpenRouter API appears to be rate limiting requests

## Technical Details

### Fixed Issues
1. Server actions were being imported in client components - moved to API route
2. Type definitions couldn't be imported from server modules - defined locally
3. Array length check was failing on undefined - added proper Array.isArray check

### Current Architecture
- API Route: `/app/api/ai/compliance-chat/route.ts`
- Client Component: `/features/ai/components/compliance-chat.tsx`
- Uses fetch() to communicate between client and server
- OpenRouter integration for AI responses

### Rate Limiting Issue
The OpenRouter API is returning 429 errors (Too Many Requests). This suggests:
- The API key may have exceeded its rate limit
- The free tier may have restrictions
- Multiple rapid requests are triggering rate limiting

## Next Steps
1. Investigate why UI components aren't rendering (likely hydration issue)
2. Add better rate limiting handling in the API route
3. Consider implementing request queuing or caching
4. Debug the component mounting/hydration lifecycle

## Supabase MCP Integration
The project has Supabase MCP integration available with the following capabilities:
- List organizations, projects, tables
- Execute SQL queries
- Deploy edge functions
- Manage branches
- Generate TypeScript types

This could be used to store chat history or cache responses to reduce API calls.
