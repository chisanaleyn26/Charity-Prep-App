# Home Page Final Solution

## What Was Wrong
The original marketing components had:
1. **Framer Motion animations** causing hydration/rendering issues
2. **Complex absolute positioning** with overlapping elements
3. **CSS variables** that weren't resolving properly
4. **Overflow hidden** containers clipping content

## Final Fix Applied
1. Created simplified components without animations
2. Used standard Tailwind colors (no CSS variables)
3. Removed complex positioning and z-index layering
4. Updated marketing layout for proper flex structure

## Current Implementation
The home page now uses:
- `HeroSimple` component - Clean, animation-free hero section
- Inline Features section - Direct in page.tsx
- Inline Pricing section - Direct in page.tsx
- All with explicit colors (black, gray-700, green-500)

## Why This Works
- No client/server hydration mismatches
- No complex CSS calculations
- Clear, predictable styling
- Standard Tailwind classes only

## Future Improvements
If you want to add back animations or complex styling:
1. Test each addition incrementally
2. Consider using CSS animations instead of Framer Motion
3. Ensure proper SSR compatibility
4. Keep fallbacks for CSS variables

The home page is now stable and fully visible! ðŸŽ‰
