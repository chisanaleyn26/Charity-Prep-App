# Webpack Module Loading Error Fix
## Date: 2025-01-28

### Problem
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call') at webpack module loading, preventing the application from running properly.

### Root Cause
The error was caused by:
1. Corrupted build cache and node_modules
2. Stale webpack compilation artifacts
3. Module resolution issues

### Solution Steps Applied

1. **Killed all Next.js processes**:
   - Found processes: PIDs 859, 860, 3259
   - Killed all with `kill -9`

2. **Cleaned all caches**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   rm -rf .swc
   rm -rf package-lock.json
   ```

3. **Verified package versions**:
   - next: ^15.3.2
   - react: ^19.1.0
   - react-dom: ^19.1.0
   - @types/react: ^19.1.0
   - @types/react-dom: ^19.1.0
   All versions are properly aligned.

4. **Reinstalled dependencies**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

5. **Updated next.config.ts**:
   - Added webpack resolve configuration to ensure proper module resolution
   - Removed turbopack configuration that was causing conflicts

### Result
- Development server starts successfully
- No webpack errors in console
- Build completes without errors
- Application loads and renders properly

### Key Takeaways
- Always clean build caches when encountering webpack errors
- Ensure all React/Next.js related packages have compatible versions
- Kill all Node processes before troubleshooting
- Fresh npm install often resolves module resolution issues

### Remaining Notes
- Deprecation warnings for `punycode` module are harmless and come from dependencies
- RLS policy error in Supabase is unrelated to webpack and needs separate fix
