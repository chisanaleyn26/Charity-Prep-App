# Compliance Chat Debugging Session - May 27, 2025

## Current Issue
The user reported: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" error

## Actions Taken

1. **Fixed Array Access Issues**
   - Added `Array.isArray()` checks before all `.map()` calls
   - Protected `complianceAlerts.map()` on line 438
   - Protected `relatedGuidance.map()` on line 471
   - Added array check in `formatMessageContent` function

2. **Removed Dynamic Import**
   - Initially tried using `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`
   - This caused the component to get stuck in loading state
   - Reverted to direct import which resolved the loading issue

3. **Current Status**
   - Page loads successfully (200 OK)
   - API is working and returning responses
   - UI is partially rendering:
     - ✅ Compliance Assistant title
     - ✅ Input field for questions  
     - ✅ Quick Actions sidebar
     - ❌ Welcome message not displaying
     - ❌ Suggested questions not showing
     - ❌ Compliance Alerts section missing

4. **Added Debug Logging**
   - Added console logs in `loadInitialData()`
   - Added console logs for message setting
   - Added render logs to track state

## Root Cause Analysis
The welcome message and suggested questions are not rendering even though the component structure is correct. This suggests either:
1. The `loadInitialData` function is not being called
2. The state is being reset somewhere
3. There's a race condition in the initialization

## Next Steps
1. Check browser console for debug logs
2. Verify `useEffect` is running on mount
3. Check if state is persisting correctly
4. Consider adding a loading state to prevent race conditions
