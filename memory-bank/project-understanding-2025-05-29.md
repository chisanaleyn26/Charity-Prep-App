# Charity Prep - Project Understanding Summary
**Date**: 2025-05-29
**Session**: Comprehensive review of all documentation

## Executive Summary

After thoroughly reviewing all documentation in `/docs` and existing memory bank files, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of **Charity Prep** - a SaaS platform helping UK charities comply with the new Charities (Annual Return) Regulations 2024.

## Core Business Context

### The Problem
- New regulations (effective 2025) expand charity reporting from 16 to 26+ questions
- 100,000+ UK charities must track detailed data on:
  - Safeguarding (DBS checks, training, policies)
  - Overseas activities (country-by-country spending, transfer methods)
  - Fundraising (income sources, major donors, methods)
- First affected returns due late 2025/early 2026 - creating urgent market need
- Massive administrative burden for resource-limited charities

### The Solution
- Purpose-built compliance platform (not generic charity software)
- AI-powered data entry (email forwarding, OCR, natural language)
- Real-time compliance scoring with visual "Risk Radar"
- One-click report generation for Annual Returns
- Year-round value to prevent post-submission churn

### Target Market
- **Primary**: Solo charity administrators (non-technical, time-poor, compliance-anxious)
- **Secondary**: Finance managers responsible for compliance
- **Tertiary**: Accountants managing multiple charity clients
- **Market Size**: 100,000+ registered charities in England & Wales

## Technical Architecture

### Core Stack
```
Frontend:    Next.js 15.2 (App Router), TypeScript, Zustand, Shadcn UI
Backend:     Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime + Storage)
AI/ML:       Gemini 2.5 Flash via OpenRouter, GPT-4 Vision for OCR
Payments:    Stripe (migrated from Paddle)
Infra:       Vercel (London region), Edge Functions
Design:      Ethereal UI (custom design system)
Special:     MCP integration for direct Supabase access
```

### Architectural Principles
1. **Server-First**: Default to Server Components, minimal client state
2. **Feature-Based Organization**: `/features/[domain]/` structure
3. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod validation
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript
5. **Multi-Tenancy**: Row-level security from day one
6. **Real-Time**: Supabase Realtime for collaboration

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Passwordless Auth**: Magic links for simplicity
- **Zustand for UI State Only**: Server is source of truth (no server data in client stores)
- **Server Actions**: All mutations via server actions
- **Mobile-First**: Critical paths optimized for mobile
- **AI-Native**: LLM integration as core feature, not bolt-on

- **Soft Deletes**: `deleted_at` timestamps, never lose data
- **UUID Primary Keys**: Global uniqueness
- **Type Safety**: Extensive use of ENUMs and constraints

### Core Tables
```sql
organizations          -- Main tenant (charity details)
users                  -- Extended from Supabase auth.users
organization_members   -- Many-to-many with roles (admin/member/viewer)
safeguarding_records   -- DBS checks, training, policies
overseas_activities    -- International operations
income_records         -- Fundraising and donations
documents             -- File storage with OCR status
ai_tasks              -- Processing queue for AI operations
subscriptions         -- Stripe subscription management
compliance_scores     -- Materialized view for performance
audit_log             -- Complete change tracking
notifications         -- Reminder and alert queue
```

### Key Constraints
- `charity_number`: Must match `^\d{6,8}(-\d{1,2})?$`
- `financial_year_end`: Must be 1st or 31st of month
- `dbs_number`: 12 digits exactly

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Critical Issues
1. **RLS Policy Recursion**: Some policies use recursive `user_organization_role()` function
2. **Component Errors**: KPICards has undefined property access issues
3. **Date Validation**: Financial year end must be 1st or 31st of month

### Technical Debt
- Certificate generation removed (react-pdf issues)
- Board pack generation needs refactoring
- Some settings pages have placeholder content
- Email processor not implemented
- Missing error boundaries in key areas

### Performance Considerations
- Need to implement Next.js 15 caching strategies
- Streaming and Suspense for progressive loading
- Dynamic imports for heavy components (PDF, charts)
- Database indexes need optimization
- Bundle size target: < 500KB initial JS

## Development Guidelines (CLAUDE.md)

### Core Principles
1. **Always read entire files** - Don't assume, know what's there
2. **Don't edit Tailwind config** without explicit permission
3. **Commit early and often** - After each working milestone
4. **Look up library syntax** - Don't assume API knowledge
5. **Run linting** after major changes
6. **Optimize for readability** - Code is read more than written
7. **No dummy implementations** - Build real features
8. **Get clarity before starting** - Ask questions
9. **No large refactors** without explicit instruction
10. **Plan architecture first** - Think, then code

### Code Organization
- Feature-based structure (`/features/[domain]/`)
- Separation of concerns (components, actions, services, types)
- Server Components by default
- Client Components only for interactivity
- Zustand for UI state only (never server data)

## MCP Supabase Integration

We have direct database access via MCP (Model Context Protocol):

### Available Commands
- Organization management
- Project operations
- SQL execution
- Migration application
- Table introspection
- Log viewing
- Branch management

### Usage Pattern
```
mcp__supabase__list_organizations
mcp__supabase__execute_sql
mcp__supabase__apply_migration
```

This enables direct database queries and management during development.

- Consider mobile experience in all features
- Follow established naming conventions
- Use Server Actions for all mutations
- Keep Zustand for UI state only
- Implement loading and error states

## Conclusion

Charity Prep is a well-architected solution addressing an urgent market need. The technical foundation is solid with modern best practices, the UX is designed for non-technical users, and the business model aligns with market opportunity. 

The backend is largely complete with comprehensive API coverage. The main work remaining is frontend implementation, AI feature completion, and performance optimization. With the regulatory deadline approaching, there's strong market timing for launch.
