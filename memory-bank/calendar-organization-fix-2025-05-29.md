# Calendar Organization Error Fix - 2025-05-29

## Problem
User was getting "Error: No organization selected" when trying to add a deadline in the calendar page.

## Root Cause Analysis
The organization context was not being properly initialized when the calendar page loaded. The issue was:

1. **Server-Client Disconnect**: The server fetched the organization but didn't pass it to the client context
2. **Race Condition**: Calendar page rendered before organization context was initialized
3. **Async Loading**: OrganizationProvider was fetching organizations asynchronously, causing delays

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Pass Organization from Server to Client
**File: app/(app)/layout-client.tsx**
```typescript
// Now passes organization to provider
<OrganizationProvider initialOrganization={organization}>
```

### 2. Update OrganizationProvider to Accept Initial Organization
**File: features/organizations/components/organization-provider.tsx**
- Added `initialOrganization` prop
- Sets organization immediately if provided
- Prevents null organization state on initial load

### 3. Fix Calendar Page Error Handling
**File: app/(app)/calendar/page.tsx**
- Changed from throwing errors to showing user-friendly toasts
- Added organization ready state tracking
- Added loading indicators
- Fixed hydration issues with disabled button state

### 4. Add Extra Safety in Deadline Modal
**File: components/deadline-modal.tsx**
- Added organization check in modal
- Shows clear error message if organization missing
- Prevents submission without organization

### 5. Added Debugging Logs
- Server layout logs organization loading
- Calendar page logs organization status
- Modal logs organization check

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Immediate Organization Setting**: Organization from server is now immediately available in client context
2. **No More Throwing Errors**: All error cases now show toast messages instead
3. **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and disabled buttons when organization not ready
4. **Multiple Safety Checks**: Both calendar page and modal verify organization exists

## Testing Steps

1. Clear browser cache/cookies
2. Restart development server if needed
3. Login and navigate to /calendar
4. Check console for organization logs
5. Try adding a deadline - should work immediately

## Expected Behavior

- Organization should be available immediately on page load
- "Add Deadline" button disabled only briefly during initial load
- No errors when creating deadlines
- Clear feedback if organization is still loading

## If Issues Persist

1. Check browser console for organization status logs
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Clear local storage and cookies
4. Check that user has a valid organization in database
