# Day 5: Webpack Error Fix

## Issue
The user reported a webpack error when accessing the Annual Return page:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')
    at options.factory (webpack.js:712:31)
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by attempting to use async Server Components with client-side code in a way that created module resolution issues. The original implementation had:
1. A server component (`ARGeneratorServer`) that was async
2. Complex server/client boundary crossing
3. Potential circular dependencies

## Solution
Simplified the architecture by:
1. Made the Annual Return page a client component (`'use client'`)
2. Removed the intermediate server component layer
3. Let the ARGenerator component handle its own data fetching via the useEffect hook
4. Made the ARGeneratorProps optional with default values

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/app/(app)/reports/annual-return/page.tsx`
- Changed from Server Component to Client Component
- Removed async data fetching at page level
- Simplified to directly render ARGenerator

### 2. Removed `/features/reports/annual-return/components/ARGeneratorServer.tsx`
- This intermediate layer was causing the webpack module resolution issues

### 3. Updated `/features/reports/annual-return/components/ARGenerator.tsx`
- Made props optional with default parameters
- Component now handles all data fetching internally

## Key Learning
When dealing with Next.js 15.2 and complex client/server boundaries:
- Keep it simple - don't over-engineer the server/client split
- If a component needs interactivity, make the whole flow client-side
- Server Actions can still be called from client components
- Webpack module errors often indicate server/client boundary issues

## Testing
The Annual Return page should now load without webpack errors and fetch data on mount via the existing useEffect hook in ARGenerator.
