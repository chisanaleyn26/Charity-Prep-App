# Login OTP Fix Summary - January 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Continue Button Not Clickable
- **Problem**: The continue button was disabled until form was valid
- **Fix**: 
  - Changed form mode from 'onBlur' to 'onChange' for immediate validation
  - Removed form validity check from button disabled state
  - Added proper preventDefault to form submission

### 2. Page Refresh on Submit
- **Problem**: Form was submitting as regular HTML form
- **Fix**: Added explicit preventDefault in form submit handler

### 3. OTP Not Being Sent
- **Problem**: Supabase was configured with placeholder credentials
- **Fix**: 
  - Used MCP tools to get real Supabase project credentials
  - Updated .env.local with actual project URL and anon key
  - Project: CharityPrep (rovdrincpttusrppftai)

### 4. Removed UI Elements
- Removed "Don't have an account?" text
- Removed "Start your free trial" link from login page

## Current Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters email
2. Supabase sends OTP via email (configured in Supabase email template)
3. User enters 6-digit OTP code
4. System verifies and logs user in

### Key Features
- Single-page flow (no redirect between steps)
- OTP auto-advance and auto-submit
- Rate limiting with progressive cooldowns
- Resend functionality with timer
- Proper error handling

### Supabase Configuration
- Email template includes both magic link and OTP token
- Template format: "Your OTP code - {{ .Token }}"
- OTP valid for 5 minutes

## Files Modified
- `/features/auth/components/email-step.tsx` - Fixed form submission
- `/features/auth/actions/auth.ts` - Removed dev mode fallback
- `/features/auth/components/login-form-otp.tsx` - Removed debug logs
- `/.env.local` - Updated with real Supabase credentials

## Testing
The login page should now:
1. Accept email input and send real OTP via Supabase
2. Show OTP verification step after email submission
3. Accept the 6-digit code from email
4. Successfully authenticate and redirect to dashboard
