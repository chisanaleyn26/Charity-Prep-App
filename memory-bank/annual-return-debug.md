# Annual Return Component Debug Analysis

## Issue Identified
The user reported a 'use client' and 'use server' issue with the Annual Return components. After investigation:

1. **Current Setup**:
   - ARGenerator.tsx is marked with 'use client' (correct for interactive component)
   - annual-return.ts actions are marked with 'use server' (correct for server actions)
   - Server actions are being imported and called correctly from the client component

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - The createServerClient import is correctly aliased in lib/supabase/server.ts
   - Server actions can be imported into client components in Next.js App Router
   - The actual error might be runtime-related or due to async/await handling

3. **Key Files**:
   - `/features/reports/annual-return/components/ARGenerator.tsx` - Client component
   - `/features/reports/annual-return/actions/annual-return.ts` - Server actions
   - `/features/reports/annual-return/types/annual-return.ts` - Type definitions
   - `/app/(app)/reports/annual-return/page.tsx` - Page component

## Next Steps
Need to:
1. Check if the error is happening at build time or runtime
2. Ensure proper error boundaries
3. Verify Supabase authentication is working correctly
4. Add proper loading states and error handling
