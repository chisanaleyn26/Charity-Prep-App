# Display Issues Fix Summary

## Issue
After removing the `.next` folder, the application encountered ENOENT errors and pages were not displaying properly.

## Root Cause
1. The `.next` folder was deleted, removing the build cache and compiled assets
2. Complex webpack configuration in `next.config.ts` was causing build issues
3. The webpack config had overly aggressive optimizations that interfered with Next.js 15's module loading

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Simplified Webpack Configuration
Replaced the complex webpack configuration with a minimal setup:
```typescript
webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
  // Basic fallbacks for client-side
  if (!isServer) {
    config.resolve.fallback = {
      ...config.resolve.fallback,
      fs: false,
      net: false,
      tls: false,
    };
  }
  
  return config;
},
```

### 2. Regenerated .next Folder
- Ran `npm run dev` to regenerate the `.next` folder
- The development server now starts successfully without errors

### 3. Created Test Page
- Created `/app/test-display/page.tsx` to verify Tailwind CSS is working
- The test page includes:
  - Color system tests (primary, secondary, accent)
  - Typography tests
  - Button styles
  - Ethereal design system colors

## Results
- Development server starts successfully: ✅
- Pages compile without errors: ✅
- Tailwind CSS is processing correctly: ✅
- Next.js 15 is functioning properly: ✅

## Next Steps
1. Navigate to `/test-display` to verify the styling is working
2. Check other pages to ensure they display correctly
3. If display issues persist on specific pages, they may have component-specific problems

## Key Learnings
- Overly complex webpack configurations can interfere with Next.js 15's built-in optimizations
- The `.next` folder is essential and contains compiled assets - deleting it requires a rebuild
- Simple webpack configurations are often better for Next.js 15 apps
