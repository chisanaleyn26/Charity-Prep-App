## Date: 2025-01-29

### Issues Fixed

1. **Font Loading Issue**
   - Removed external Google Fonts import that was causing loading issues
   - The Inter font is already being loaded via Next.js font optimization in layout.tsx

2. **Test Files Cleanup**
   - Removed all test pages that were potentially causing conflicts:
     - app/css-test-fixed
     - app/simple-test  
     - app/style-test
     - app/tailwind-test
     - app/(app)/basic-test
     - app/css-test.html
     - app/globals-fixed.css

3. **Build Artifacts**
   - Cleaned .next directory
   - Cleared node_modules cache
   - Removed conflicting test files

### What to Do Now

2. The CSS should now load properly with:
   - Tailwind CSS classes working correctly
   - Inter font loading via Next.js font optimization
   - No scattered design elements

3. If you still see styling issues, check:
   - Browser developer tools for CSS loading errors
   - Network tab to ensure CSS files are being loaded
   - Console for any JavaScript errors
