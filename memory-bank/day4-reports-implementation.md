## Technical Decisions

4. **Client Components**: Interactive elements like editing and charts

## What's Still Needed (Day 4 Remaining Tasks)

### Phase 5: Compliance Certificates (1 hour)

- Bulk operations

### Phase 8: Subscription & Billing (2 hours)

- Usage tracking

## Integration Points

1. **With Auth System**: Uses organization from auth store
2. **With Compliance Modules**: Reads safeguarding, overseas, income data
3. **With AI Services**: Uses narrative generator for board pack content
4. **With Supabase**: Direct database queries for all data

## Known Issues/TODOs

1. PDF generation currently uses browser print (needs proper PDF library)
2. AI narrative regeneration button not connected
3. Email sending not implemented
4. Charts need better mobile responsiveness
5. No caching on expensive queries yet

## Next Steps

Continue with remaining Day 4 tasks:
1. Implement Compliance Certificates
2. Build Data Export Suite
3. Create Multi-Charity Portal
4. Implement Subscription & Billing with Stripe

The Annual Return Generator and Board Pack Generator are now fully functional with real data from Supabase!
