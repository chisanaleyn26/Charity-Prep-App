**OCR Features**:
- Support for JPEG, PNG, PDF documents
- Visual field highlighting on extracted areas
- Zoom, rotate, and preview controls
- Field-level confidence scoring
- Auto-detection of document types

### 4. Import Management âœ…
**User Experience**:
- `/app/(app)/import/page.tsx` - Unified import dashboard
- Magic inbox email address with copy functionality
- Side-by-side queue and review interface
- Quick action cards for different import methods
- Real-time import status tracking

## UI/UX Consistency

### Design Patterns Followed:
- **Ethereal Theme**: Consistent use of Inchworm green (#B1FA63) for AI features
- **Bento Layout**: Grid-based card layouts matching dashboard style
- **Loading States**: Progress bars and skeleton loaders for async operations
- **Confidence Indicators**: Color-coded badges (green/yellow/red) for extraction confidence
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized for quick capture scenarios

### Component Reusability:
- Extended existing UI components (Badge, Card, Button, etc.)
- Added new components: ScrollArea, Tabs for better UX
- Consistent icon usage from Lucide React
- Maintained shadcn/ui component patterns

## Technical Implementation Details

### AI Integration Pattern:
```typescript
const response = await callOpenRouter(async () => {
  return await openrouter.chat.completions.create({
    model: AI_MODELS.VISION,
    messages: [...],
    response_format: { type: 'json_object' },
    temperature: 0.1
  })
})
```

### Extraction Flow:
1. Document/Email received â†’ AI Task created
2. Content processed with appropriate prompt
3. Structured data extracted with confidence scores
4. User reviews in side-by-side interface
5. Approved data saved to appropriate tables

### Error Handling:
- Graceful fallbacks for AI failures
- Manual entry options always available
- Clear error messages with retry capabilities
- Confidence thresholds for auto-approval

## Navigation Updates
Added "Smart Import" to sidebar with AI badge indicator at position 5 in main navigation.

## Next Steps (Remaining Day 3 Tasks)

### 5. CSV Import with AI Mapping
- Column mapping wizard
- AI-powered field matching
- Bulk import processing
- Progress tracking

### 6. Natural Language Search
- Query parser service
- Vector embeddings setup
- Smart search UI
- Cross-module search

### 7. AI Report Generation
- Narrative generation service
- Template system
- Report builder integration

### 8. Compliance Q&A Bot
- Knowledge base indexing
- Chat interface
- Citation system
- Context management

## Performance Considerations
- Implemented request queuing to avoid rate limits
- Caching for common extractions
- Optimistic UI updates
- Background processing for large files

## User Feedback Integration
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Clear success/error states
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Confidence scores visible throughout

## Magic Moments Achieved
1. âœ… "Just forwarded a receipt and it appeared!"
2. âœ… "Took a photo and everything was filled in!"
3. ðŸ”„ "It knew which CSV columns were which!" (pending)
4. ðŸ”„ "I typed what I wanted in plain English!" (pending)
5. ðŸ”„ "It wrote my report section for me!" (pending)

The AI infrastructure is solid and the extraction features are working beautifully. Users can now forward emails or snap photos to instantly capture compliance data.
