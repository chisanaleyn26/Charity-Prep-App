# Charity Prep - Comprehensive Project Understanding
*Updated: 2025-05-28*

## Executive Summary

After thoroughly reviewing all documentation in `/docs` and memory bank files, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of **Charity Prep** - a SaaS platform designed to help UK charities comply with the new Charities (Annual Return) Regulations 2024. The project is well-architected using Next.js 15.2, Supabase, and AI integrations to solve a critical compliance problem for 100,000+ UK charities.

## Project Context

### The Problem
- **New Regulations**: Charities (Annual Return) Regulations 2024 expand reporting from 16 to 26+ questions
- **Compliance Burden**: Detailed tracking required for safeguarding, overseas expenditure, and fundraising
- **Urgency**: First affected returns due late 2025/early 2026
- **Market Gap**: No purpose-built solution exists for these specific regulations

### The Solution
- **Purpose-Built Platform**: Designed specifically for new Annual Return requirements
- **AI-Powered Automation**: OCR extraction, email processing, natural language search
- **Real-Time Compliance**: Visual "Risk Radar" shows compliance status instantly
- **Year-Round Value**: Continuous tracking prevents last-minute panic

### Target Market
- **Primary**: Solo charity administrators (non-technical, time-poor, compliance-anxious)
- **Secondary**: Finance managers responsible for compliance
- **Tertiary**: Accountants managing multiple charity clients
- **Market Size**: 100,000+ registered charities in England & Wales

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
```
Frontend:    Next.js 15.2 (App Router), TypeScript, Zustand, Shadcn UI
Backend:     Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime + Storage)
AI/ML:       Gemini 2.5 Flash (via OpenRouter), GPT-4 Vision (OCR)
Infra:       Vercel (London), Edge Functions
Payments:    Stripe
Email:       Resend
Design:      Ethereal UI (custom design system)
```

### Architectural Principles
1. **Server-First Architecture**: Default to Server Components, minimal client state
2. **Feature-Based Organization**: `/features/[domain]/` structure
3. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod validation
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript
5. **Multi-Tenancy**: Row-level security from day one
6. **Real-Time Updates**: Supabase Realtime for collaboration

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Passwordless Auth**: Magic links for simplicity
- **Zustand for UI State Only**: Server is source of truth
- **Server Actions**: All mutations via server actions
- **Mobile-First**: Critical paths optimized for mobile
- **AI-Native**: LLM integration as core feature

## Database Architecture

### Schema Design Philosophy

- **Audit Trail**: Complete change history in `audit_log`
- **Soft Deletes**: `deleted_at` timestamps (never lose data)
- **UUID Keys**: Global uniqueness
- **Type Safety**: ENUMs for fixed values

### Core Tables
```sql
organizations          -- Tenant/charity information
users                  -- Extended from Supabase auth
organization_members   -- Many-to-many with roles (admin/member/viewer)
safeguarding_records   -- DBS checks and training
overseas_activities    -- International operations
income_records         -- Fundraising and donations
documents             -- File storage with extraction status
ai_tasks              -- Processing queue for AI operations
compliance_scores     -- Materialized view for performance
audit_log             -- Complete change tracking
notifications         -- Reminder and alert queue
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Indexed foreign keys and common queries
- Materialized views for compliance scores
- Partial indexes for soft deletes
- JSONB for flexible metadata
