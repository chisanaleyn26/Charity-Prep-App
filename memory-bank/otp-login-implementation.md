# OTP Login Implementation - January 2025

## Overview
Completely rebuilt the login page replacing the non-functional magic link system with a Supabase OTP (One-Time Password) authentication flow.

## Key Changes

### 1. Authentication Method
- **Before**: Magic link email authentication (not working)
- **After**: 6-digit OTP code authentication
- **Reference**: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-passwordless

### 2. User Flow
- Single-page experience (no redirect to verify page)
- Two-step process on same page:
  1. Email input step
  2. OTP verification step (auto-advances to this after email submission)

### 3. New Components Structure

```
/features/auth/
├── actions/
│   └── auth.ts              # Server actions (sendOTP, verifyOTP, resendOTP)
├── components/
│   ├── email-step.tsx       # Email input component
│   ├── otp-input.tsx        # 6-digit OTP input with auto-advance
│   └── login-form-otp.tsx   # Main form orchestrating the flow
└── hooks/
    └── use-otp-timer.ts     # Timer hook for resend cooldown
```

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Server Actions (Replacing API Routes)
```typescript
// /features/auth/actions/auth.ts
export async function sendOTP(data: { email: string })
export async function verifyOTP(data: { email: string; otp: string })
export async function resendOTP(data: { email: string })
```

#### Key Features
1. **Rate Limiting**: Progressive cooldowns (60s → 120s → 180s)
2. **OTP Input**: 
   - Auto-advances between digits
   - Supports paste operation
   - Auto-submits when complete
   - Keyboard navigation (arrows, backspace)
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and user feedback
4. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during async operations
5. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

### 5. Security Measures
- Server-side validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Progressive cooldowns for repeated attempts
- Secure session handling after successful verification

### 6. User Experience Improvements
- No page redirects during authentication
- Clear error messages
- Visual feedback for all interactions
- Resend functionality with countdown timer
- Auto-focus management for smooth flow

### 7. Files Modified
- `/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Updated to use new LoginFormOTP
- `/app/(auth)/login/loading.tsx` - Added loading skeleton
- Removed dependency on old `login-form.tsx` component

### 8. Build Status
- All TypeScript checks pass
- No linting errors
- Build completes successfully
- No runtime errors detected

## Implementation Notes
- Followed Next.js 15.2 patterns with Server Actions
- Used Suspense boundaries for better loading states
- Maintained consistent error handling patterns
- Ensured mobile-responsive design
- Kept accessibility as a priority

## Future Considerations
- Could add biometric authentication support
- Consider adding "Remember me" functionality
- Might implement device trust for known devices
- Could add email allowlist for additional security
