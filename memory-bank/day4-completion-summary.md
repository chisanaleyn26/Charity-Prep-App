## 🛠 Technical Implementation Highlights

### Architecture Patterns Used
- **Server Components by default** with 'use client' only when needed
- **Feature-based organization** with clear separation of concerns
- **Type-safe implementation** with TypeScript and proper database schema alignment
- **Zustand for state management** with persistence for auth and UI state
- **Real-time updates** via Supabase subscriptions

### Database Schema Alignment
- Fixed role type mismatches (admin/member/viewer instead of owner/advisor)
- Corrected user_role enum usage throughout components
- Ensured type safety with proper casting and null checking
