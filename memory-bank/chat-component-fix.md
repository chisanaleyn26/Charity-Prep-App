# Chat Component Fix - Hydration and Module Errors

## Issue
The ComplianceChat component was causing multiple errors:
1. "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" 
2. Webpack module resolution errors
3. Hydration mismatches

## Root Causes
1. Complex state initialization with database queries in ComplianceChat
2. Server/Client component mixing issues
3. Possible circular dependencies in imports

## Solution
Created a simplified SimpleChat component that:
- Has no external dependencies (no Supabase, no complex imports)
- Uses only basic React state
- Avoids hydration issues by not using Date.now() in initial render
- Uses basic HTML/Tailwind instead of shadcn components

## Implementation
```typescript
// features/ai/components/simple-chat.tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export function SimpleChat() {
  // Simple state with no complex initialization
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Array<{text: string, isUser: boolean}>>([
    { text: 'Hello! How can I help you with charity compliance today?', isUser: false }
  ])
  // ... rest of component
}
```

## Key Changes
1. Removed all Supabase database calls
2. Removed shadcn UI components temporarily
3. Used index-based keys for messages (not ideal but avoids Date.now() issues)
4. Made the page a client component with 'use client'
5. Simplified all imports and dependencies

## Next Steps
Once the basic chat is working, gradually add back:
1. Shadcn UI components
2. Proper message IDs (using crypto.randomUUID())
3. Database integration (fetch data in page, pass as props)
4. AI features
