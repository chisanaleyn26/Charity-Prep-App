# Landing Page Investigation Summary

## Issue
The landing page is not showing content, only displaying the background.

## Investigation Steps Taken

### 1. Component Structure Analysis
- Landing page at `/app/page.tsx` correctly imports Hero, Features, Pricing, Footer
- All components are properly exported
- Hero component uses framer-motion animations with 'use client' directive

### 2. Layout Analysis
- Landing page uses root layout (`/app/layout.tsx`)
- Root layout applies Inter font and includes globals.css
- Marketing layout exists at `(marketing)/layout.tsx` but landing page doesn't use it

### 3. CSS/Tailwind Analysis
- Fixed hardcoded hex colors to use theme colors
- CSS variables are properly defined in globals.css
- Tailwind config uses TypeScript (`tailwind.config.ts`)

### 4. Potential Root Causes

#### A. Text Color Matching Background
The foreground color is defined as `hsl(155, 20%, 18%)` which might be too light or matching the background in certain conditions.

#### B. Framer Motion SSR Issues
The Hero component uses framer-motion animations which might cause hydration mismatches or rendering issues.

#### C. CSS Variable Resolution
The text colors use CSS variables like `text-foreground` which resolves to `hsl(var(--foreground))`. If the CSS variables aren't loading properly, text might be invisible.

#### D. Z-Index Issues
Although the content has `relative z-10`, there might be stacking context issues.

### 5. Key Findings
1. The page structure is correct
2. Components are properly imported/exported
3. CSS classes were updated from hardcoded hex to theme colors
4. The issue is likely related to color contrast or CSS variable resolution

## Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Force Black Text (Immediate Fix)
Replace theme colors with explicit black text to verify content is rendering:
```tsx
// In Hero component
className="text-black" // instead of text-foreground
```

### Solution 2: Remove Animations (Test)
Create a static version without framer-motion to eliminate animation issues.

### Solution 3: Check CSS Variable Loading
Ensure CSS variables are being properly loaded and computed by the browser.

### Solution 4: Use Inline Styles (Debug)
Use inline styles with explicit colors to bypass any CSS processing issues:
```tsx
style={{ color: 'black' }}
```
