# Auth Flow Fixed

## Changes Made

### 1. Login Redirect Logic
- Users with existing organizations now go directly to `/dashboard` after login
- Only new users without organizations are redirected to `/onboarding`
- The app layout checks `needsOnboarding` to enforce this

### 2. Organization Switcher Enhanced
- Added "Create New Organization" option at the bottom
- Uses a plus icon and primary color to stand out
- Clicking it redirects to `/onboarding`

### 3. Onboarding Page Adaptive UI
- Detects if user already has organizations
- Shows different content:
  - **New users**: "Welcome to Charity Prep!"
  - **Existing users**: "Add Another Organization"
- Added back button for existing users to return to dashboard

## User Flow

### New User:
1. Sign up / Login → Redirected to `/onboarding`
2. Create first organization
3. Redirected to `/dashboard`

### Existing User:
1. Login → Redirected directly to `/dashboard`
2. Can switch between organizations using org switcher
3. Can add new organizations via:
   - Organization switcher → "Create New Organization"
   - Goes to `/onboarding` with adaptive UI

## Additional Options

If you want more ways to add organizations, you could add a button in:
1. **Settings page**: Add an "Organizations" section
2. **Dashboard**: Add a card for "Add Another Organization"
3. **Header**: Add a plus button next to the org switcher

The infrastructure is now in place to support multiple organizations per user seamlessly!
