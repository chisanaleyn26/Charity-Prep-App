# Reports Main Page Update

## Issues Found
1. Not using consistent UI pattern with other pages (no icon in header)
2. Using container classes instead of direct layout
3. Hardcoded stats (compliance score, reports generated, next annual return)
4. Different card styling than compliance pages

## Changes Made
1. Updated header to match compliance pages pattern (icon + extralight font)
2. Removed container classes for consistent spacing
3. Added proper data fetching for stats
4. Updated card styling to match compliance pages
