# Checkout Session Error Fix

## The Problems Fixed

### 1. Async Supabase Client
**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getUser')`
**Cause**: `createServerClient()` is now async but was being used synchronously
**Fix**: Added `await` before `createServerClient()`

```typescript
// Before (wrong):
const supabase = createServerClient()

// After (correct):
const supabase = await createServerClient()
```

### 2. Missing Required Fields
**Error**: Validation errors from the API
**Cause**: The billing page wasn't sending all required fields
**Fix**: Added all required fields to the checkout request

```typescript
// Now sends:
{
  priceId: actualPriceId,
  organizationId: currentOrganization.id,
  successUrl: `${window.location.origin}/settings/billing?success=true`,
  cancelUrl: `${window.location.origin}/settings/billing?canceled=true`,
}
```

### 3. Missing Organization Context
**Issue**: Couldn't access current organization in the handler
**Fix**: Added `useOrganization` hook to get the current organization

## Complete Working Flow

1. User clicks "Get Started" on a pricing plan
2. System gets:
   - Current organization ID
   - Correct price ID for tier/cycle
   - Success/cancel URLs
3. Creates checkout session with all required data
4. Redirects to Stripe Checkout

## Testing the Fix

1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Have an organization selected
3. Click any "Get Started" button
4. Should redirect to Stripe Checkout

## Debug Output

The console will show:
```
Creating checkout for: {
  tier: "STANDARD",
  cycle: "yearly",
  actualPriceId: "price_1OZK8lE0TsJw..."
}
```

If there's an error, it will show in the toast notification with details.
