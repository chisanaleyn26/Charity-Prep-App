3. **User Experience** - Clean, consistent UI across all modules
4. **Export Formats** - Multiple formats supported (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON, etc.)
5. **Real-time Generation** - All reports generate on-demand with current data

## Technical Highlights:
- Server components with client interactivity where needed
- Proper error handling and loading states
- TypeScript types throughout
- Zod schema validation
- Clean separation of concerns

## Production Readiness:
- **Ready**: Annual Return, Board Pack, Certificates, AI Reports
- **Needs Work**: Export module (add persistence and background jobs)

## User Value:
1. **Annual Return** - Saves hours of manual data compilation
2. **Board Pack** - Professional reports for trustees in minutes
3. **Certificates** - Motivates compliance improvement
4. **Export** - Flexible data extraction (once persistence added)
5. **AI Reports** - Insightful narratives from raw data

## Recommendations:
1. Priority: Fix Export module persistence layer
2. Add export queue for large data sets
3. Implement email delivery for scheduled exports
4. Consider adding more certificate types
5. Cache AI-generated content for performance

## Summary:
The Reports module is 80% production-ready with 4 out of 5 sub-modules fully functional. The Export module works but needs backend persistence to be complete. Overall, this is a robust reporting system that provides significant value to charity organizations.
