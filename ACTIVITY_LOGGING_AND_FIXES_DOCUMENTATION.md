# Activity Logging Implementation and Recent Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document details all changes made during the implementation of activity logging, security fixes, organization management simplification, and recent UI improvements.

## 1. Security Fixes

### 1.1 Authentication Error Handling System
**File Created**: `/lib/errors/auth-errors.ts`
- Implemented comprehensive auth error system with user-friendly messages
- Provides clear guidance and auto-recovery paths for users
- Error codes include: NO_ORGANIZATION, NO_USER, INVALID_SESSION, SESSION_EXPIRED, REFRESH_FAILED

### 1.2 SQL Injection Prevention
**Files Modified**: 
- `/lib/api/safeguarding.ts`
- `/lib/api/overseas.ts`
- `/lib/api/income.ts`

**Changes**:
- Replaced string interpolation with parameterized queries
- Added input validation and sanitization
- Used Supabase's built-in query builders instead of raw SQL

### 1.3 Rate Limiting Infrastructure
**File Created**: `/lib/security/rate-limiter.ts`
- Implemented configurable rate limiting for critical endpoints
- Added protection for auth endpoints (login: 5 requests/15min, signout: 10 requests/min)
- Prevents brute force attacks and abuse

## 2. Organization Management Fixes

### 2.1 Organization Switching Bug Fix
**File Modified**: `/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Added `router.refresh()` after organization switch to force data reload
- Fixed issue where dashboard data wasn't updating when switching organizations
- Added useEffect dependency on `currentOrganization?.id`

### 2.2 Auth Flow Bug Fix
**File Modified**: `/app/login/page.tsx`
- Changed `.single()` to `.limit(1)` in organization query
- Fixed critical bug that was creating duplicate organizations
- Prevents SQL error when user has multiple organizations

### 2.3 Organization Picker Removal
**Files Modified**:
- Removed organization picker component entirely
- Simplified navigation as 95%+ of users manage only one charity
- Reduced UI complexity and confusion

## 3. Dashboard Improvements

### 3.1 Compliance Status Dashboard
**File Created**: `/features/dashboard/components/compliance-status-dashboard.tsx`
- Replaced trend chart with status-first design
- Shows current score, urgent actions, and category breakdown
- Mini trend section for historical context
- Consistent rounded-2xl styling throughout

### 3.2 Dashboard Header Simplification
**File Modified**: `/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Changed header from text-4xl to text-3xl
- Removed redundant compliance score from header
- Shows user email instead of organization name in welcome message

### 3.3 Quick Actions Styling (Option C)
**File Modified**: `/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Implemented subtle color scheme with consistent dashboard UI
- Green for safeguarding, blue for overseas, purple for AI assistant
- Added hover effects and consistent border styling
- Maintained rounded-2xl for consistency

### 3.4 Activity Feed Height Fix
**File Modified**: `/features/dashboard/components/realtime-activity-feed.tsx`
- Fixed height constraints to allow proper flexing
- Added `w-full` for proper width handling
- Changed rounded-3xl to rounded-2xl for consistency

## 4. Activity Logging Implementation

### 4.1 Activity Logging Service
**File Modified**: `/lib/services/activity-logging.service.ts`
- Fixed "use server" error by removing object exports
- Changed adminClient import to createServiceClient
- Implements logging for user activities and audit events
- Uses service client to bypass RLS for proper logging
- Functions: logActivity, logAuditEvent, getRecentActivities, getRecentAuditLogs

### 4.2 Activity Types Constants
**File Created**: `/lib/constants/activity-types.ts`
- Moved ActivityTypes and AuditActions from service file
- Prevents "use server" directive errors
- Defines all activity types for consistency across the app
- Includes page views, compliance actions, document actions, etc.

### 4.3 Activities API Route
**File Created**: `/app/api/v1/organizations/[orgId]/activities/route.ts`
- **Fixed Next.js 15 params handling error**:
  - Changed params type to `Promise<{ orgId: string }>`
  - Added `const { orgId } = await params` at the start
  - Replaced all `params.orgId` with `orgId`
- Provides endpoint for fetching organization activities
- Transforms both activity logs and audit logs into consistent format
- Includes helper functions for formatting and icons

### 4.4 Activity Logging Integration
**Files Modified**:
- `/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`: Logs dashboard page view
- `/features/dashboard/components/compliance-status-dashboard.tsx`: Logs compliance score view
- `/features/compliance/components/score/compliance-score-client.tsx`: Logs score views and tab changes

## 5. Database Cleanup
- Removed duplicate organizations using MCP Supabase tools
- Fixed data consistency issues
- Cleaned up test data

## 6. Key Technical Patterns Used

### 6.1 Next.js 15 Compatibility
- Async params in route handlers
- Proper "use server" directive usage
- Constants separation to avoid server/client conflicts

### 6.2 Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages with user guidance
- Graceful fallbacks for failed API calls
- Non-blocking logging (errors don't break the app)

### 6.3 UI Consistency
- Standardized on rounded-2xl for cards
- Consistent hover effects and transitions
- Subtle color scheme for actions and status

### 6.4 Performance Optimizations
- Service client for bypassing RLS where appropriate
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Batched API calls where possible

## 7. Testing Checklist
- [x] Organization switching updates dashboard data
- [x] Auth flow doesn't create duplicate organizations
- [x] Activity logging works without errors
- [x] Dashboard displays user email correctly
- [x] Compliance status dashboard shows correct data
- [x] Quick actions have consistent styling
- [x] Activity feed displays properly
- [x] Activities API route works without params errors

## 8. Future Considerations
- Consider implementing activity log retention policies
- Add more granular activity tracking for compliance modules
- Implement activity-based insights and analytics
- Consider real-time activity updates via WebSocket

## Summary
All critical issues have been resolved:
1. Security vulnerabilities fixed with proper error handling and rate limiting
2. Organization management simplified and bugs fixed
3. Dashboard UI improved with better visual hierarchy
4. Activity logging fully implemented with Next.js 15 compatibility
5. All "simple details" like async params have been properly addressed
